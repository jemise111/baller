###What is BallerNYC?
BallerNYC is a web application that serves as a desitination for all pickup basketballers in New York City and the surrounding area, to find courts and set up games with players of similar skill level before ever stepping foot outside. Don't bother with the frustration of traveling all over the city looking for good runs. Find courts near you, set up a game, and start playing at [ballernycco.com](http://ballernycco.com).
